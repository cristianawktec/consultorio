<strong> Lead generation landing pages </strong>

The most valuable piece of information you can get from a lead gen page is someone’s email address – which gives you permission to continue talking/marketing to them.

<strong> Click-through landing pages </strong>

Click-through pages (sometimes called jump pages) are designed as a conduit between a marketing ad and it's final destination. The goal of a click-through page is to “warm-up” the visitor to the product/service you are trying to sell.

Commonly used for e commerce, click-through pages provide enough information to inform the buyer, making them ready to purchase, before pushing them further down the funnel – probably to a shopping cart or checkout.
